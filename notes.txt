Track deltas of departure times and the next arrival time at the following stop?
Is it possible to track one Trip ID and average the amount of time it takes between each stop?
If comparing against the averages, is it possible to determine if a train is stalled between two stops?
In any case, is there an update message on the feed that states whether the a particular trip ID is delayed?
The train was held with an announcement message at Graham Ave - is that also represented on the feed?
